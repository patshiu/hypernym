        <h3>Hypernym’s mission: make the maintenance of interactive educational exhibits easier to sustain.</h3>
        <p>As exhibits in Math, Science, and even Art museums increasingly rely on digital and physical interactivity, planning for obsolescence is now more crucial than ever. The technologies used to build these exhibits, within only several years, may be discontinued or no longer supported.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to identify sustainable exhibit design practices–techniques in fabrication, documentation, and preservation that consider the lifespans of of both hardware and software.</p>
